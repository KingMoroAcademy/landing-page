### project description

This is a dynamic landing page, it's required as the first project in the EGFWD and Udacity professional track, it's all about dealing with the Dom, manibulating the Elements with JS and extra some awesome stylins.  

### usage

This page could be used as a portfolio page or service page and even with some quick edits as a product page.  

### how to use

The Navmenu is dynamic menu, it's data depending on your index.html page sections, the menu link to the section will always be the dection id, and the menu link text will be the data-nav value of your section, so please choose something meaningful.  
when click on a menu item will be smoothly scolled to it's section, the section itself will have class active, and the menu item you've already clicked will be focused too, not only when you click on the nav item, but also if you scolled in the page you will see the nav menu items changing too depending on which section is already in the viewport.  
The menu and the website sections are responsive, you can try it in different screen sizes for PC, tablet and mobile devices.  
Also i have designed and enhanced this template to work on all modern browsers. so i hope you like it :)
